# Animal-Crossing-Friends
Web App for users of Animal Crossing (iOS and Android) to share eachothers IDs to make more friends.

Not yet done.

Half working: http://138.197.50.244/AnimalCrossingFriends/

Unverified ID = person manually entered their ID #. (it could be fake/wrong, hence why it's "unverified")

Verified ID = person uploaded an image of their account w/ID # showing. Using an OCR API, we'll extract the ID # from the image and call it "verified"... 

People will be more attracted to using Verified ID's since it'd ensure authentic and functioning IDs.

Honestly might remove Unverified ID later on in the future.

Obviously need to work on the UI etc, and there's no visible way to add ID's currently.
